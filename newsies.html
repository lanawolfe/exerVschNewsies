            Once again our country and many other countries are worrying about a virus that doens't seem to want to goaway. What do we do? What can we do? How do we owrk to protect ourselves and those around us? Do masks work? if we social distance is that enough?  Will this vaccine actually cure virus that seems to be taking over so many of our lives?!
         <p >  We need to give people courage!</P>

         <p>With so many people out of work, it is difficult for people to keep a positive attitude or even look for courage.  It is up to us as a country to support our citizens and to protect each other in every way possible.  Together we will get through this pandemic and back to life as we used to know it.</p></p></div></p></div>
